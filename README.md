# my-mastermind
The provided Python code implements a console-based version of the Mastermind game. The `Mastermind` class manages the game, generating a random color combination for the player to guess. The player inputs guesses, receiving feedback in the form of '*' for correct color and position, and 'o' for correct color in the wrong position. The game continues until the correct combination is guessed. After each round, the player can choose to play again or quit. The code structure is modular, with methods like `generate_sample` and `check_ans` for managing game mechanics.
